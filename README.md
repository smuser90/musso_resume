# Sam Musso's Resume

## Description

This repository is version control for my resume. It's taken me 10+ years to see the benefit in having the source of truth be an easily diffable LaTeX file that can live in source control, but I'm here now. This is the last time I start my resume 'from scratch' because I lost word document I generated the pdf from several years prior. 

## Installation (Linux / WSL)

```bash
sudo apt install texlive
```

## Generation

```bash
pdflatex Sam_Musso_Resume.tex
```
